But fear not! He channeled his inner tortoise and adopted the \"slow and steady wins the race\" mentality. Progress! He managed to get some VMs communicating. \"Eureka!\", he cried, only to discover he'd built a *custom* context into the *wrong* context! Cue the debugging session, fueled by (probably) copious amounts of caffeine. After that he got someone to setup wingman so he can build and deploy code. And at some point they finished their day at rock beach which they had to run and test code and play around with their new app that somebody wants to change\"\n\nIn other words, another perfectly normal, rollercoaster-of-emotion-filled day in the life of a software developer.\n\n\nüéµ Summary published to Nostr!\nEvent ID: 0000036e30121a043de137707c370d83a71b577fd2c8412918af457eb23cfa5d"

After a review with a panel of esteemed digital adjudicators, they transformed the PRD into delicious work packages, fit for a developer sub-agent (serves 2-4, may contain traces of AI). Crucially, everything was reviewed extensively in Obsidian!\n\nThen, with a flourish and a click, they told the sub-agent to *make it so*. Apparently, testing it on mobile was harder than expected, leading to a \"Hmmmm\" moment. And here's the kicker: they accidentally created the code in the Obsidian vault! One step forward, two steps back! After a quick update to the recipe, Our hero then had the joy of getting stuck in Nano (the text editor, not the size) on their phone, because keybindings are hard! Finally, though, a new recipe adjustment did land, so it seems they finally got out. All in all, a day of triumph and tribulation, programming mishaps and mobile text editor related existential crises!\n\n\nüéµ Summary published to Nostr!\nEvent ID: 00000ce3406cb82bec1a2edc6b23a513128a79d7469e780479b5d9cbb77905b3"

Apparently, \"Goose\" was having a particularly bad day, resembling a canine with... well, let's just say it wasn't having its best appendage day.\n\nFinally, after some tinkering and a cryptic confession of a love for making changes to the source code, victory was declared! \"Now we're cooking :)\" they proclaimed, implying a potential side gig as a mobile chef with a side of deployment scripts. All in all, a pretty standard day in the life of a tech wizard, punctuated by the existential dread of a malfunctioning Goose.\n\n\nüéµ Summary published to Nostr!\nEvent ID: 00000bfa665264db0ecd33ba98f292e2e76c08cd8cc5e5fa4a312b0ca1dc384b"
